%%%%
%%%   This function  performs the learning of the
%%%%  recurrent and feedforward connectivity matrices.
%%%%
%%%%
%%%%  it takes as an argument the time step ,dt, the membrane leak, lambda, 
%%%%  the learning rate of the feedforward and the recurrent
%%%%  conections epsf and epsr, the scaling parameters alpha and beta of
%%%%  the weights, mu the quadratic cost, the number of neurons on the
%%%%  population Nneuron, the dimension of the input, the threshold of
%%%%  the neurons  an the initial feedforward and recuurrent connectivity F
%%%%  and C.
%%%%
%%%%   The output of this function are arrays, Fs abd Cs, containning the
%%%%   connectivity matrices sampled at exponential time instances Fs and
%%%%   Cs , The Final connectivity matrices F and C. It also gives the
%%%%   Optimal decoders for each couple of recurrent and feedforward
%%%%   connectivities registered in Fs and Cs. The output ErrorC contains
%%%%   the distance between the current and optimal recurrent connectivity
%%%%   stored in Cs. 
%%%%
%%%%   It also produces two figures. The first one it repsents the
%%%%   connectivities before and after learning and the second figure
%%%%   represents the performance of the network through learning.
